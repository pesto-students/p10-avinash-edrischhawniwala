Once a user enters a URL into the browser, it goes through a series of steps to retrieve the desired result. The browser's primary function is to act as a bridge between the user and the web server. It accesses the server's web pages and displays them on the user's screen. To accomplish this, the browser is made up of several high-level components that collaborate to fetch and display the web page.

The User Interface, Browser Engine, Rendering Engine, Networking, JavaScript Interpreter, and Data Storage are the high-level components of a browser. The User Interface of a browser is the component that allows the user to interact with the browser. The Browser Engine communicates with the User Interface and the other browser components. The Rendering Engine is in charge of displaying the requested web page on the user's screen, while the Networking component makes HTTP requests to the server to retrieve the web page. The JavaScript Interpreter runs JavaScript on the web page. Finally, Data Storage is the persistence layer of a browser that stores data locally, such as Cookies and Local Storage.

The Rendering Engine is one of the most important parts of a browser because it is in charge of displaying the requested web page on the user's screen. The Rendering Engine parses HTML and CSS files and renders them in an understandable manner. It represents the web page using the Document Object Model (DOM) and the styles applied to the web page using the CSS Object Model (CSSOM). The Rendering Engine creates a tree-like structure called the render tree after parsing the HTML and CSS files. The render tree is a hybrid of the DOM and CSSOM, and it is responsible for displaying the web page on the user's screen.

Parsers are used to parse HTML, CSS found on a web page. They parse the web page and generate a structured representation of it, which the Rendering Engine then uses to display the web page. Script Processors are used to handle JavaScript that is embedded in web pages. They run the scripts and perform the necessary updates.

The order of script processing is important because scripts can modify the web page, and the Rendering Engine must display the web page in a way that reflects the changes made by the scripts. Scripts are executed in the order in which they appear on the web page. Finally, after constructing the render tree, the Rendering Engine performs layout and painting. Layout is the process of calculating the exact position and size of each element in the render tree, while painting is the process of drawing the web page on the user's screen.
